                <h1>Why I use Linux</h1>
                <p>I have been using linux for more than half a year now. Over the course of time I have tried quite a few distributions. Many people also have made fun of me for using linux. But the thing is that they don't know why I use linux. So in this brief article I go over the reasons why i switched from Windows to Linux.  </p>
				<p>When I first got the laptop I currently use, it had windows preinstalled on it. Now, I ran windows as my daily driver for over a year, but I encountered many problems while doing so. 
				
					
					
					 <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
						 <li><B>Lack of RAM</B> - My laptop is not a very high end laptop and hence it only has about 3.6 GB of usable memory. The problem I faced was that windows would use about 50% of memory when idle and more than 70% when doing regular day to day tasks. My laptop would easily hit 90% RAM usage which would cause heating and then slowing down of the laptop.</li>
						 <li><B>Lack Of Applications</B> - Another problem I faced was the lack of software. It isnt technically a problem, its kind of a conflict of preference. Now dont get me wrong, windows has a wide range of applications, each with it own merits and demerits. But if i wanted to customise my Operating system to how I wanted it to be or if I wanted to try out a different window manager, I couldnt do it as it would not be availible on windows</li>
</ul> </p>
			

			<p>With all this said, window is a good operating system in its own right. Different people have different tastes and you should never really judge something without trying it out first. And with this basic principle applied, I feel Linux is the operating system for me.</p>
