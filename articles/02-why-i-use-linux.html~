                <h1>Why OS Superiority Is A Joke</h1>
                <p>
                In the world of technology, there are a lot of wars. Phone Wars, text editor wars etc. The basic idea of these wars is that a user of a certain software or hardware try to claim that their product is superior in so and so ways. One such war is the war between users of different Operating Systems. Now I do not mean that all the users engage in these wars. There are a countless number of people who are happy with what they chose and respect others choice. But then again there are people who want to prove that their platform or an OS that they use is superior.
